          <li>
          Men: Suit, or a dress shirt and pants</li>
          <li>Women: Conservative dress, business

        <li> If your ticket is because of a missing or obscured sign, take a picture, print it out, and bring it with you to court. </li>
        <li> If your ticket is because of a leasee, make sure you've taken the necessary steps.  (Check out our site for more.) </li>
        <li> Write out the argument you're going to make, and practice it a few times. </li>
        <li> If you'll be reading your statement off a script, make sure to bring a paper copy. </li>
